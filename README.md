FYP1 F22 081 D SocialGuard. Sample code

This code folder holds the overall frontend and backend code along with the machine learning models used. The node modules are not uploaded due to size limitations. 

The training.ipynb notebook uses sklearn libraries for model training, including SVC, AdaBoost (Scratch + Prebuilt), MLP, RFC, and SVC from scratch (errors in implementation). The pipeline.py takes an image as input, extracts text with OCR, applies a ML model to it, and determines the severity of the case accordingly.
