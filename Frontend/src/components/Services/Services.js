                <h1 className={classes.H1}> Cyber Harassment Case Analysis </h1>
                <p className={classes.p1}> SocialGuardian analyzes cases with the aid of Natural Language Processing (NLP), <br /> Machine Learning (ML) models, and context awareness features. <br />
                    Our primary system extracts text from the provided evidence, <br /> which can be screenshots of chats or comments, in order to analyze it further. <br />
                    Similarly, SocialGuardian determines whether the user has provided <br /> sufficient legitimate evidence for the case to be redirected to <br /> higher investigative authorities.
                    In addition to this, these cases are categorized by <br /> their type and severity level </p>





                <h1 className={classes.H2}> Verified Case Referrals To the FIA </h1>
                <p className={classes.p1}> SocialGuardian analyzes each case along with its evidence in order to verify it.<br />
                    Once the provided evidence  is analyzed and checked for adequacy, <br /> each case is categorized and labelled with a severity rating.<br />
                    These cases are then redirected for further investigation to the  <br /> Cyber Crime Wing
                    of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) <br /> based on their priority or severity rating. </p>
